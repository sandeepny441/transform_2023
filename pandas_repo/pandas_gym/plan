Pandas Basics:

Understanding Series and DataFrames
Reading data from various sources (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.)
Basic DataFrame operations (filtering, sorting, etc.)


Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values (detecting, dropping, filling)
Removing duplicates
Type conversion
Data Wrangling:

Merging, joining, and concatenating DataFrames
Reshaping and pivoting
Applying functions (both built-in and user-defined)
Data Aggregation and Group Operations:

Group by operations
Aggregation functions (mean, sum, count, custom aggregations)
Data Transformation:

Mapping
Binning
Encoding categorical variables
Time Series Analysis:

Resampling
Moving window functions
Working with timestamps
Performance:

Understanding pandas' data types and how they affect memory usage
Utilizing vectorized operations
Applying operations in chunks (useful for large datasets)
Visualization:

Using pandas' built-in plotting capabilities
Advanced Topics:

Working with text data
Working with hierarchical indexing
Proficiency with the pandas API, e.g., defining and using accessor methods
Remember that pandas is a tool for data manipulation and while it is crucial, FAANG interviews will also test your understanding of various other concepts like data structures, algorithms, machine learning, statistics, etc. So, while learning pandas thoroughly, also focus on these other aspects.z
